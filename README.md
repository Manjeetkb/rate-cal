The rate constant for ion-molecule reactions occurring in CI-MS (PTR-MS) is computed. Provide the CAS number of the molecule 
along with the E/N value and temperature. Then click on the radio button to select the reagent ion for the ion-molecule reaction. 
Click on the submit button: get the rate constant of the reactions along with other useful information about the reaction kinetics. 
Note: The CSV file should be in the same directory as the code. Currently, ~150 molecules are provided with their physical and chemical parameters. 
User can add their own molecules and modify the list. 

﻿# rate-cal (Window)
